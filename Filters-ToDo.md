#Filters To Do

- Select drop downs not ideal for user experience - consider switching to checkboxes for multi select
- Noticed that the Nice Design System didn't have Select drop downs 
- As a quick win, wanted to clear Select drop downs when a new selection is made but realised clearing all others onChange caused an infinte loop, or always set all selects to not selected.
- Select drop downs would work better in this instance if they were built up to filter the content
- Check values exist and disable Select drop down options for those without matching values
- Add Test to check navigator values haven't changed in code compared to data
- Improve user experience by adding more data to each result card e.g tagging with document types
- Filter takes up a lot of the page. Could be pinned to the side and allow the content to scroll
- Pagination works ok for the small sample of data, but if there were 1000 documents the pagination links would run on from 1-100. next and previous also not much better - would need something more adaptive
